The /r/StarWarsBattlefront mod team has recently helped the mods of /r/StarWarsGames revamp their sub in preparation for EA Play, where we are expecting to hear a lot of new info about new Star Wars titles.

Any posts about Skirmish that existed prior to this thread will remain, but I will be removing any posts after this one that don't provide new information, and will direct the OP to this thread instead.
